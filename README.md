## Why does this exist?

Sometimes i just want to create a quick and small website to test something or explore an idea quickly without downlaoding lots of npm modules.

so i created this, which can only be described as budget `react` :)

and i also wanted to explore the virtual dom idea.

**NOTE**: there's alot of great projects that make use of jsx and they're production ready and stable, you should use those in your production apps; this is just an exploration.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/5alidz/create-nano-spa.git ./my-app && cd my-app
```
## What is create-nano-spa?

it's a quick way to start a project with everything setup for you.

keep in mind that all client-side routers rely on serving `index.html` when hitting any route, and `create-nano-spa` is setup exactly to behave like that.

please check [Deployment](#deployment)

after cloning `create-nano-spa` run `npm install` or `yarn`

notice there's `src` and `static` directories, the `src` directory will be minified and inlined inside `index.html` (this will change),  and the `static` directory will be copied to `dist` as is.

let's imagine you have an image inside `static/my-img.png` and a component inside `src/components/Img.js`.

```javascript
// src/components/Img.js

const Img = () => render`<img src='/static/my-img.png' />`

```

to build your app `npm run build` or `yarn build`

## Features

- Routing.
- Composable components [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm).
- Async components.
- speed. (since it's less than 4kb it loads very fast over slow 3g connection)
- SEO friendly.

## Routing

`nano_spa` provides two basic function as its api `router` and `render`

### router

```javascript
import { router, render } from 'nano_spa'

router({
  root: document.getElementById('app'),
  routes: { '/': () => render`<div>Hello, world!<//>` },
  head: {
  '/': () => render`
    <title>Home</title>
    <meta name='description' content='my home page'/>
  `
  },
  methods: {
    on_route_mount: (route, dom_node) => {
      // maybe page transition?
    },
    on_route_unmount: (route, dom_node) => {
      // do work when component get replaced.
    }
  },
  // opt out of caching.
  cache: ['/']
})

```

ignoring the details for now, but this is it. the entire api of `nano_spa`

please **NOTE** that `head` doesn't accept a component as value of a route, consider the following.

```javascript
const Home = () => render`
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, world</h1>
  <//>
`

const HomeHead = () => render`
  <title>Home</title>
  <meta name='description' content='my home page'/>
`

router({
  routes: {
    // works perfectly fine.
    '/': () => render`<${Home} />`
  },
  head: {
    // WARNING: this doesn't work.
    '/': () => render`<${HomeHead} />`
  }
})
```
this is because head elements by nature is an array like and this is not valid jsx.
instead just pass it as function. (this might change)

```javascript
// ...
  head: {
    '/': HomeHead
  }
// ...
```
### special routes

There's two kind of special routes:
- `'*'` inside `routes` which will get renderd if no routes are matched, a `404` if you will.
- `'*'` inside `head` will get added to the html head element once and will be present on all routes.
- `'/my-route/(.+)'` a regex that will get matched to a component.

```javascript
//...
  routes: {
    // ...
    '/blog/(\\w+)': (matches) => render`<${BlogPost} matches=${matches}/>`,
    '*': () => render`<${NotFound} />`
  },
  // this will reflect on head too.
  head: {
    // ...
    '/blog/(\\w+)': (matches) => render`<title>${matches[0]}</title>`
    '*': () => render`<meta name='author' content='5alidz' />`
  }
// ...
```

### async component

**Important**
- await any values you will use inside `render`.
- any async component requires a `placeholder` prop to render until the async component is ready.

```javascript
async function Lazy() {
  // wait one second then resolve the promise.
  const text = await new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve('Hello, world'), 1000)
  })
  return render`<div>${text}</div>`
}

function WithLazy() {
  return render`
    <div>
      <p>this will load instantly</p>
      <${Lazy} placeholder=${() => render`<div>...</div>`} />
    </div>
  `
}
```

### Deployment

once you feel happy about your app run `npm run build` this will populate dist folder with `index.html` and `/static`.

the key concept to make a client side spa is serving `index.html` on every route.

#### using Netlify

`cd dist/ && touch _redirects` and the following to `_redirects`.
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

that's it, if you have installed `netlify-cli` then just run `netlify deploy`

### using zeit's Now

`cd dist/ && touch now.json` and add the following to `now.json`

```javascript
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
        "src": "/static/(.*)",
        "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=31536000,immutable" },
        "dest": "/static/$1"
    },
    {"src": "/robots.txt", "dest": "/static/robots.txt"},
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "headers": {"cache-control": "s-maxage=0"},
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

enjoy ðŸŽ‰
